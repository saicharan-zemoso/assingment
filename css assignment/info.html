            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>Hi, i'm saicharan</p>
            <p>I am 21 years old and was born on 14 march 2002. I am a very passionate person and very much intrested in learning new things.
                I am a person who this that life is limitless. we experience new things and as we continue to experience them repeatedly the feel changes every time. 
            Thats why i think we should explore as much we want and as many times that we want because every movement in our life makes us what we are today.</p>
            <p>One of the ways that i learnet to explore about my self is by coding. when i am coding i try to view the problem in as many ways that are possible it may take time but 
                i can know what i'm capalbe of and find new ways to solve a problem it may some time the wrong solution to a perticular problem but it can be a best solution for other problems
            </p>
            <p>I love to code and solve different puzzels and watch anime. These are the main reason that i choose b tech and computer science engineering. It is beautiful to think that we can build a machine that can talk and act like us because of the knowledge thet we use to 
                code the machine and develop a machine that can do what a normal human can do using our wonderful brain.
            </p>
            <p>Another thing that is a major part of my life is my family that thought me everything that i know today every part of my life have an impact on me everything that i have learnt made me what i am today.
                 My family encouraged me to learn and experience life in a beautiful way.
            </p>
